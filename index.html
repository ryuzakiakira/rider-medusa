        <h2>INFO</h2>
        <p>Rider is first seen scouting around Homurabara Gakuen. Rider is silent, sultry, and vigilant, never hesitating to shield her Master from harm.
           With Shinji incapable of lending any Prana to her, she is forced to seek alternative means to augment her abilities. To compensate for this 
           weakened state, Rider employs covert battle tactics and takes full advantage of any territory around her. Her weapon of choice is a pair of 
           long iron nails fastened to opposite ends a single chain, which she effectively thrusts from distances. <br />
            <br />
           She is voiced by Yu Asakawa in Japanese and Karen Strassman in 2006 In English. She is also by Melissa Fahn. </p>
